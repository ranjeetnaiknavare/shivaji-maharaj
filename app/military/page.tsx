              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is renowned for his military genius and innovative warfare tactics. Despite
                commanding smaller forces than his adversaries, he consistently outmaneuvered and defeated larger armies
                through strategic brilliance, knowledge of terrain, and unconventional tactics.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                His military achievements include capturing over 300 forts, establishing a powerful navy, and
                successfully challenging the mighty Mughal Empire and other regional powers of his time.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                One of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's most significant contributions to military strategy was his
                perfection of guerrilla warfare, known as "Ganimi Kava" (enemy tactics). This approach allowed his
                smaller forces to effectively combat the numerically superior armies of the Mughals and other powers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Key elements of Ganimi Kava included:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Mobility and speed: Maratha forces could cover large distances quickly, allowing for surprise attacks.
                </li>
                <li>Knowledge of terrain: Utilizing the mountainous Sahyadri range to their advantage.</li>
                <li>
                  Intelligence network: Maintaining an extensive spy system that provided crucial information about
                  enemy movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hit-and-run tactics: Attacking swiftly and retreating before the enemy could organize a counterattack.
                </li>
                <li>Night raids: Conducting operations under the cover of darkness to maximize surprise.</li>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">Notable Military Campaigns</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Battle of Pratapgad (1659)</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                One of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's most famous victories was against Afzal Khan, a general of the
                Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur. When Afzal Khan attempted to kill Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj during
                what was supposed to be a peaceful meeting, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was prepared with concealed
                weapons and killed the general instead. The Maratha forces then routed the Bijapur army in the ensuing
                battle.
              </p>

              </div>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Raid on Shaista Khan (1663)</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                When Mughal general Shaista Khan occupied Pune and established his residence in Chhatrapati Shivaji
                Maharaj's palace, Lal Mahal, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj executed a daring night raid. With a small band
                of men, he infiltrated the heavily guarded palace and attacked Shaista Khan, who barely escaped but lost
                his fingers in the process. This audacious act demonstrated Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's courage and
                tactical brilliance.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Sack of Surat (1664)</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj led a raid on Surat, one of the Mughal Empire's richest ports, acquiring
                significant wealth while specifically avoiding harm to foreign traders and common citizens. This
                strategic raid not only provided resources for his campaigns but also directly challenged Mughal
                authority, prompting Emperor Aurangzeb to take personal interest in subduing Chhatrapati Shivaji
                Maharaj.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">Naval Power</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Recognizing the strategic importance of controlling the coastline, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a
                strong navy that consisted of approximately 400 ships of various types. This naval force protected
                Maratha territories from European powers like the Portuguese, British, and Dutch, while also securing
                trade routes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj constructed coastal forts like Sindhudurg, Vijaydurg, and Kulaba to protect
                his naval interests. His admiral, Kanhoji Angre, would later become legendary for his naval prowess and
                for keeping European powers at bay.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Forts were central to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's military strategy. He captured, renovated, and built
                numerous forts across the Western Ghats, creating a network of strongholds that formed the backbone of
                the Maratha Empire. These forts were strategically located to control important trade routes and provide
                defensive advantages.
